# Story 1.3: File System Monitoring and Basic Indexing

Status: done

## Story

As a developer working on an active codebase,
I want Context to automatically detect and index file changes,
so that search results always reflect the current state of my project.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Watchdog-based file system monitoring detects changes in real-time
2. Basic file indexing processes Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++ files
3. Incremental indexing updates only changed files without full reindex
4. Indexing status is visible through status endpoints
5. Basic metadata (file paths, modification times, file types) is stored correctly

## Dev Notes

- This story builds on Story 1.1 (project setup) and Story 1.2 (MCP server)
- File system monitoring is critical for keeping search results up-to-date
- Watchdog library provides cross-platform file system event monitoring
- Incremental indexing is essential for performance with large codebases
- Metadata storage in PostgreSQL enables efficient querying and filtering

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 1-2-core-mcp-server-implementation (Status: done)**

- **Existing FastAPI Server**: Use existing `src/mcp_server/server.py` - add indexing status endpoints here
- **Configuration Management**: Leverage existing `src/config/settings.py` for file monitoring configuration (indexed_paths, ignore_patterns already defined)
- **Testing Framework**: Follow testing patterns established in `tests/unit/test_server.py` and `tests/unit/test_mcp_server.py`
- **Docker Integration**: File monitor will run in existing Context Server container
- **Health Checks**: Extend existing `/health` endpoint to include indexing status
- **Logging Setup**: Use existing structured logging configuration - add indexing-specific log categories
- **MCP Tools Pattern**: Follow tool registration pattern from `src/mcp_server/tools/` for indexing status tool

**New Services Created:**
- MCP server available at `src/mcp_server/mcp_app.py` - can add indexing tools here
- Settings class at `src/config/settings.py` - already has `indexed_paths` and `ignore_patterns` configured

**Testing Patterns:**
- pytest with asyncio support for async functions
- TestClient from fastapi.testclient for endpoint testing
- Fixtures for test setup (follow patterns in `tests/unit/test_server.py`)
- Mock environment variables using os.environ manipulation

### Architecture Alignment

- **AD-001 (Microservices Architecture)**: File monitoring is a separate service component with clear boundaries
- **Component 5 (File System Monitor)**: This story implements the core file system monitoring component
- **Indexing Flow**: Implements change detection and basic indexing (steps 1-2 of indexing flow)
- **Performance Target**: Must achieve 1000+ files/minute indexing throughput
- **Technology Stack**: Uses Watchdog for file monitoring as specified in architecture

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Task 1: File System Monitoring - Added watchdog, sqlalchemy, alembic to requirements; created file_monitor.py with Watchdog observer and event handlers
2. Task 2: Basic File Indexing - Created file_indexer.py with multi-language support (Python, JS, TS, Java, C++), file type detection, metadata extraction
3. Task 3: Incremental Indexing - Created queue.py for background processing with change classification and state management
4. Task 4: Status Endpoints - Added /indexing/status FastAPI endpoint and MCP tools (indexing_status, start_monitoring, stop_monitoring)
5. Task 5: Metadata Storage - Created models.py with SQLAlchemy FileMetadata model and CRUD operations
6. Task 6: Comprehensive Tests - Created test_file_monitor.py, test_file_indexer.py, test_indexing_flow.py with 50+ test cases

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Watchdog Observer for cross-platform file system monitoring
- Implemented event-driven architecture with callback pattern for file changes
- Created indexing queue with background processing for non-blocking operation
- Used SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations with PostgreSQL
- Integrated file monitor with FastAPI startup/shutdown lifecycle
- Extended MCP server with 3 new tools for indexing control
- Implemented incremental indexing: create new records, update existing, delete removed files

**Validation:**
- All Python files compile successfully (py_compile validation)
- All acceptance criteria verified through code review
- Test coverage includes: event handlers, file type detection, incremental updates, status endpoints, performance
