# Story 3.1: Ollama Integration and Local LLM Management

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer using AI-assisted coding,
I want Context to integrate with local LLM models through Ollama,
So that AI processing happens entirely within my development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Ollama client integration connects to local Ollama service
2. Model management supports downloading, loading, and switching between models
3. Health monitoring ensures Ollama service availability and model readiness
4. Configuration allows customizing model selection and inference parameters
5. Error handling gracefully manages Ollama service failures and model issues

## Tasks / Subtasks

- Implement Ollama client service with connection management
- Add model management capabilities (list, download, load, unload)
- Create health check and monitoring for Ollama service status
- Add configuration support for model selection and inference parameters
- Implement error handling and fallback strategies
- Add MCP tools for model management and status checking
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Update documentation with Ollama setup and usage instructions

## Integration Points

- Story 1.6 (Configuration): Leverage existing config system for Ollama settings
- Story 1.7 (Logging): Use structured logging for Ollama operations
- Story 2.1-2.4 (Search): Foundation for AI-enhanced search in future stories
- Docker Compose: Ensure Ollama service is included in deployment

## Performance Targets

- Model loading completes within 30 seconds for typical models (7B parameters)
- Inference latency under 2 seconds for typical code analysis queries
- Memory usage scales predictably with model size
- Service health checks complete within 500ms

## Deliverables

- Ollama client service with connection management
- Model management system with download/load/unload capabilities
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Configuration integration for model selection
- MCP tools for model operations
- Comprehensive tests and documentation
- Docker Compose integration
