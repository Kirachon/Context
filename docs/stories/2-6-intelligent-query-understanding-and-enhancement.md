# Story 2.6: Intelligent Query Understanding and Enhancement

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer using natural language queries,
I want Context to understand query intent and enhance with relevant context,
So that search results are more accurate and comprehensive.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Natural language processing understands query intent and context
2. Query enhancement adds relevant context from recent changes and project patterns
3. Follow-up questions help refine and clarify search intent
4. Query history provides quick access to previous searches
5. Query analytics identify common search patterns and needs

## Tasks / Subtasks

- Build query intent classifier (NLP-based intent detection)
- Implement query enhancement engine (context injection)
- Add query history storage and retrieval
- Create follow-up question generator
- Build query analytics and pattern detection
- Add MCP tools for query operations
- Write unit tests for all components
- Documentation and examples

## Integration Points

- src/search/semantic_search.py (existing search engine)
- src/analysis/cross_language.py (pattern detection)
- src/analysis/dependency_analysis.py (dependency context)
- src/vector_db/ast_store.py (code context retrieval)
- src/mcp_server/tools/ (MCP tool exposure)

## Deliverables

- Query understanding module (intent classifier)
- Query enhancement module (context injection)
- Query history service
- Query analytics service
- MCP tools for query operations
- Unit tests covering all components
- Story documentation/context
