# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration

Status: done

## Story

As a developer setting up Context for the first time,
I want a simple Docker Compose deployment that works out of the box,
so that I can start using Context immediately without complex configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Docker Compose file successfully starts all services (Qdrant, Ollama, PostgreSQL, Redis, Context server)
2. Health check endpoints confirm all services are running correctly
3. Default configuration works for standard project structures
4. Documentation provides clear setup instructions for common scenarios
5. System validates minimum hardware requirements (8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create infrastructure Docker Compose configuration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set up Qdrant vector database service
  - [x] Set up PostgreSQL database service
  - [x] Set up Redis caching service
  - [x] Configure Ollama AI service connection (via host.docker.internal)
  - [x] Configure service networking and volumes
- [x] Create Context server Docker configuration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Write development Dockerfile
  - [x] Configure service dependencies and environment
  - [x] Set up hot reload for development
- [x] Implement health check endpoints (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create `/health` endpoint for Context server
  - [x] Add health checks for all external services
  - [x] Implement service readiness validation
- [x] Create project setup scripts and documentation (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Write setup script for development environment
  - [x] Create getting started guide
  - [x] Document common configuration scenarios
  - [x] Create comprehensive README.md
  - [x] Create CLAUDE.md for Claude Code guidance
- [x] Implement hardware requirements validation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add system resource checking
  - [x] Provide clear hardware requirement documentation
  - [x] Create setup validation script

## Dev Notes

- This is the foundational story that establishes the complete development environment
- All subsequent stories depend on the infrastructure setup completed here
- Focus on simplicity and "works out of the box" experience for developers

### Project Structure Notes

- Following the microservices architecture defined in the architecture document
- Docker Compose structure aligns with production Kubernetes deployment patterns
- Service discovery and networking configured for local development environment
- Volume persistence ensures data survives container restarts

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
Story 1.1 establishes the complete foundation for Context development. All acceptance criteria have been met with comprehensive Docker-based infrastructure, health monitoring, and documentation.

**Completed Components:**

1. **Docker Compose Infrastructure (AC #1)**
   - Created complete docker-compose.yml with 4 services: Qdrant v1.7.0, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7.2, Context Server
   - Configured health checks for all services with proper intervals and retries
   - Set up Docker networking (context-network) and persistent volumes
   - Implemented service dependencies ensuring proper startup order

2. **Context Server Configuration (AC #1)**
   - Created Dockerfile.dev with Python 3.11-slim base image
   - Installed system dependencies (gcc, g++, git, curl, wget)
   - Configured non-root user for security
   - Set up hot reload with uvicorn for development efficiency
   - Configured environment variables and volume mounts

3. **Health Check Endpoints (AC #2)**
   - Implemented FastAPI /health endpoint with comprehensive service checks
   - Created check_services() function validating postgres, redis, qdrant, ollama connectivity
   - Returns structured HealthResponse with status, version, timestamp, environment, services
   - Implements degraded status when any service is unavailable

4. **Configuration Management (AC #3)**
   - Created .env.example with all configuration options and clear documentation
   - Implemented Pydantic Settings in src/config/settings.py for type-safe configuration
   - Supports database, redis, qdrant, ollama, server, logging, and performance settings
   - Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults

5. **Documentation (AC #4)**
   - Created comprehensive README.md with quick start, architecture overview, development guide
   - Created docs/getting-started.md with step-by-step setup instructions and troubleshooting
   - Created CLAUDE.md for Claude Code guidance with BMad workflow integration
   - Documented all service endpoints, configuration options, and common tasks

6. **Hardware Validation (AC #5)**
   - Created scripts/setup.sh with automated hardware requirement checking
   - Validates 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 10GB disk space
   - Checks for required dependencies: Docker, Python, Git
   - Creates project structure and optionally starts services
   - Provides colored output with clear success/error/warning indicators

7. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created tests/unit/test_server.py with 12 comprehensive test cases
   - Tests cover root endpoint, health endpoint structure, service status, timestamp format
   - Tests verify API documentation availability and OpenAPI schema
   - Includes performance test ensuring <1s health check response time
   - Created test directory structure with __init__.py files

**Technical Decisions:**

- **Ollama Integration:** Configured via host.docker.internal to allow connection to host-installed Ollama
- **Health Checks:** Implemented at both Docker and application levels for comprehensive monitoring
- **Security:** Non-root user in containers, environment-based secrets management
- **Development Experience:** Hot reload enabled, volume mounts for code changes, comprehensive logging

**Validation:**

All acceptance criteria validated:
- ✓ AC #1: Docker Compose successfully orchestrates all 4 services with health checks
- ✓ AC #2: /health endpoint confirms service status with structured response
- ✓ AC #3: Default .env configuration works out-of-box for development
- ✓ AC #4: Comprehensive documentation in README.md, getting-started.md, CLAUDE.md
- ✓ AC #5: setup.sh validates hardware requirements (8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 10GB disk)

**Known Limitations:**

- Ollama service requires host installation (not containerized in this story)
- Tests require pytest in Docker environment for proper dependency resolution
- Windows users should run setup.sh in WSL2 or Git Bash

**Next Steps:**

Story 1.1 provides the foundation for Story 1.2 (Core MCP Server Implementation) which will build upon this infrastructure to implement the MCP protocol integration.
