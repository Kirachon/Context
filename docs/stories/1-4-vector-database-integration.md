## Dev Notes

- This story builds on Story 1.3 (file monitoring and indexing)
- Qdrant is already running in Docker Compose (port 6333)
- Vector embeddings enable semantic search functionality
- Collection per codebase allows multi-project support
- Embeddings should be generated during file indexing

### Learnings from Previous Stories

**From Story 1-3-file-system-monitoring-and-basic-indexing (Status: done)**

- **Indexing Integration**: File indexer at `src/indexing/file_indexer.py` - extend to generate embeddings during indexing
- **Queue Processing**: Indexing queue at `src/indexing/queue.py` - add embedding generation to processing pipeline
- **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy models at `src/indexing/models.py` - may need to store embedding metadata
- **Status Endpoints**: Pattern established in `/indexing/status` - follow for `/vector/status`
- **MCP Tools**: Pattern in `src/mcp_server/tools/indexing.py` - create similar tools for vector operations
- **Testing Patterns**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests - follow same structure

**From Story 1-2-core-mcp-server-implementation (Status: done)**

- **FastAPI Integration**: Add vector status endpoint to `src/mcp_server/server.py`
- **Health Checks**: Extend `/health` endpoint to include Qdrant status
- **Configuration**: Use `src/config/settings.py` for Qdrant connection settings (already has qdrant_host, qdrant_port)
- **Startup/Shutdown**: Follow lifecycle pattern for Qdrant client initialization

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Task 1: Qdrant Connection - Added qdrant-client, sentence-transformers, torch to requirements; created qdrant_client.py with connection management and health checks
2. Task 2: Embedding Generation - Created embeddings.py with SentenceTransformer integration, text chunking, and caching
3. Task 3: Vector Storage - Created vector_store.py with upsert, search, delete operations and batch processing
4. Task 4: Collection Management - Created collections.py with per-codebase strategy and collection lifecycle management
5. Task 5: Health Monitoring - Extended /health endpoint with Qdrant status, added /vector/status endpoint
6. Task 6: Comprehensive Tests - Created test_vector_integration.py with 25+ test cases covering all components

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used sentence-transformers with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384 dimensions) for code embeddings
- Implemented collection-per-codebase strategy for multi-project support
- Added text chunking for large files (512 character chunks with line-aware splitting)
- Integrated vector generation into existing file indexing pipeline
