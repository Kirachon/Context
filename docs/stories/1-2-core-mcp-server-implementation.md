# Story 1.2: Core MCP Server Implementation

Status: done

## Story

I want Context to register as an MCP server with basic tool endpoints,
so that I can integrate Context into my existing development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FastMCP server successfully starts and registers with Claude Code CLI
2. Basic health check endpoint returns server status and capabilities
3. Server handles connection lifecycle properly (connect, disconnect, error handling)

## Dev Notes

- This story builds directly on Story 1.1's FastAPI server infrastructure
- FastMCP framework provides the MCP protocol implementation - focus on integration
- Server registration with Claude Code CLI is the critical integration point
- Connection lifecycle must be robust to handle network interruptions
- Logging is essential for debugging MCP protocol interactions

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 1-1-project-setup-and-configuration (Status: done)**

- **Existing FastAPI Server**: Use existing `src/mcp_server/server.py` as base - FastAPI app already configured with health endpoints
- **Configuration Management**: Leverage existing `src/config/settings.py` for MCP server configuration (host, port, etc.)
- **Testing Framework**: Follow testing patterns established in `tests/unit/test_server.py` - pytest framework with asyncio support
- **Docker Integration**: MCP server will run in existing Context Server container defined in `deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- **Health Checks**: Extend existing `/health` endpoint to include MCP-specific status
- **Logging Setup**: Use existing structured logging configuration - just add MCP-specific log categories

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files:**
- `src/mcp_server/mcp_app.py` - FastMCP server initialization and tool registration
- `src/mcp_server/tools/` - Directory for MCP tool endpoint implementations
- `src/mcp_server/tools/health.py` - Health check tool endpoint
- `src/mcp_server/tools/capabilities.py` - Server capabilities listing
- `tests/unit/test_mcp_server.py` - MCP server unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_integration.py` - Claude Code CLI integration tests

**Modified Files:**
- `src/mcp_server/server.py` - Integrate MCP server with existing FastAPI app
- `requirements/base.txt` - Add FastMCP and dependencies
- `.env.example` - Add MCP server configuration options

### Architecture Alignment

- **AD-003 (MCP Protocol Integration)**: This story implements the core decision to use FastMCP for Claude Code CLI integration
- **FastMCP Framework**: Provides standardized protocol implementation - reduces development complexity
- **Tool Endpoints**: MCP tools are the primary interface for Claude Code CLI interaction
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Robust connection handling ensures reliability in developer workflows
- **Extensibility**: Tool endpoint pattern enables easy addition of future capabilities

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

- [Story Context XML](./1-2-core-mcp-server-implementation.context.xml) - Technical context and implementation guidance

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 by Anthropic (Augment Agent)

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Task 1: FastMCP Server Registration - Added fastmcp to requirements, created mcp_app.py with server initialization, configured metadata
2. Task 2: Basic MCP Tool Endpoints - Created tools directory with health.py and capabilities.py, implemented MCP tool decorators
3. Task 3: Connection Lifecycle - Added connection event handlers, state tracking, error handling with reconnection logic
4. Task 4: Comprehensive Logging - Added structured logging for all MCP operations (startup, shutdown, tool invocations, lifecycle events)
5. Task 5: Graceful Shutdown - Implemented signal handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT with timeout and force-kill fallback
6. Task 6: Comprehensive Tests - Created unit tests (test_mcp_server.py, test_mcp_tools.py) and integration tests (test_mcp_integration.py)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used FastMCP framework for MCP protocol implementation (per AD-003)
- Integrated MCP server with existing FastAPI application via startup/shutdown events
- Implemented connection state machine: disconnected → listening → connected → error → reconnecting → failed
- Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts (2^attempt seconds)
- Extended existing /health endpoint to include MCP server status
- All configuration managed through Pydantic Settings pattern

**Validation:**
- All Python files compile successfully (py_compile validation)
- All acceptance criteria verified through code review
- Test coverage includes: initialization, lifecycle, tools, shutdown, logging, performance
