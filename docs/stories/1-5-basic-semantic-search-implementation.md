## Dev Notes

- This story builds on Stories 1.3 (file indexing) and 1.4 (vector database)
- Uses existing vector embeddings and Qdrant integration
- Provides the first working semantic search functionality
- Foundation for Epic 2 advanced search features

### Learnings from Previous Stories

**From Story 1-4-vector-database-integration (Status: done)**

- **Vector Search**: Use `search_vectors()` from `src/vector_db/vector_store.py` for similarity search
- **Embedding Generation**: Use `generate_embedding()` from `src/vector_db/embeddings.py` for query embeddings
- **Collection Management**: Collections already set up for codebase organization
- **Performance**: Vector search already optimized with caching and batch operations

**From Story 1-3-file-system-monitoring-and-basic-indexing (Status: done)**

- **File Metadata**: Use `src/indexing/models.py` for file information and metadata
- **File Types**: Supported languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++
- **Indexing Pipeline**: Files already indexed with metadata and vectors
- **Status Endpoints**: Follow pattern from `/indexing/status` for search status

**From Story 1-2-core-mcp-server-implementation (Status: done)**

- **FastAPI Integration**: Add search endpoint to `src/mcp_server/server.py`
- **MCP Tools**: Follow pattern from `src/mcp_server/tools/` for search tools
- **Response Models**: Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Follow existing error handling patterns

### Project Structure Notes

- `src/search/__init__.py` - Search package initialization
- `src/search/semantic_search.py` - Core semantic search service
- `src/search/models.py` - Search request/response models
- `src/search/filters.py` - Search filtering logic
- `src/search/ranking.py` - Result ranking and scoring
- `src/mcp_server/tools/search.py` - MCP search tools
- `tests/unit/test_semantic_search.py` - Search service unit tests
- `tests/unit/test_search_filters.py` - Filtering unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_search_api.py` - Search API integration tests

**Modified Files:**

### Architecture Alignment

- **Component 4 (Search Engine)**: This story implements the core search engine component
- **Performance Target**: Must achieve <500ms response time (AC #4)
- **Search Flow**: Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Ranking → Results
- **Integration**: Uses existing vector database and file indexing infrastructure

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

- [Story Context XML](./1-5-basic-semantic-search-implementation.context.xml) - Technical context and implementation guidance (to be generated)

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 by Anthropic (Augment Agent)

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Task 1: Search API Endpoint - Created search package with models.py, semantic_search.py; added /search/semantic and /search/stats endpoints
2. Task 2: Ranking and Scoring - Created ranking.py with composite scoring (similarity, file size, file type, freshness); implemented deduplication
3. Task 3: Filtering - Created filters.py with file type, directory, exclude pattern, and min score filtering
4. Task 4: Performance Optimization - Implemented result caching with TTL, performance metrics tracking, optimized for <500ms response
5. Task 5: Error Handling - Added query validation, empty result handling, comprehensive logging, meaningful error messages
6. Task 6: MCP Tools - Created search.py with 4 tools: semantic_search, search_with_filters, search_statistics, get_search_capabilities
7. Task 7: Comprehensive Tests - Created test_semantic_search.py with 20+ test cases covering all functionality

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used composite scoring: 70% similarity, 10% file size, 10% file type, 10% freshness
- Implemented 5-minute cache TTL for search results with MD5 cache keys
- Code snippet extraction limited to 10 lines with truncation indicator
- File size scoring prefers 1KB-50KB range (optimal for code files)
- Freshness scoring: <1 day=1.0, <7 days=0.9, <30 days=0.7, <90 days=0.5, >90 days=0.3
- Result deduplication by file path to avoid duplicate entries

**Integration Points:**
- Uses vector embeddings from Story 1.4 for semantic search
- Leverages file indexing from Story 1.3 for metadata
- Integrated with FastAPI server for REST endpoints
- Added 4 MCP tools for Claude Code CLI integration
