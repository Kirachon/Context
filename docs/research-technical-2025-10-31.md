## Architecture Decision Record

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection for Context

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Context is a 100% offline AI coding assistant built as an MCP server for Claude Code CLI. The project requires sub-200ms search latency, multi-language support, and enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining complete data sovereignty.

**Decision Drivers:**
1. 6-month MVP delivery timeline
2. 100% offline/air-gapped deployment requirement
3. Multi-language code support (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust)
4. Sub-200ms search latency requirement
5. Open-source only technology stack
6. Enterprise deployment simplicity

**Considered Options:**

**Vector Database:**
- Qdrant (Selected): Rust-based, high performance, advanced filtering
- Weaviate: Go-based, GraphQL API, hybrid search
- Milvus: Python/C++, distributed architecture, GPU acceleration

**Local LLM Inference:**
- Ollama (Selected): User-friendly, model management, CLI focus
- Llama.cpp: High performance, C++ core, extensive hardware support
- GPT4All: Desktop app, curated models, beginner-friendly

**Code Parsing:**
- Tree-sitter (Selected): Multi-language, incremental parsing, robust
- ANTLR: Grammar-based, powerful but complex, Java-based
- Python AST: Language-specific, built-in, Python only

**MCP Server Framework:**
- FastMCP (Selected): Pythonic, high-level, rapid development
- Custom Implementation: Maximum control, MCP protocol direct
- FastAPI-based: Web framework integration, async support

**Decision:**
Selected technology stack: **Qdrant + Ollama + Tree-sitter + FastMCP + Python ecosystem**

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**
- Excellent developer experience with rapid development timeline
- 100% offline capability meets all privacy requirements
- Strong performance with sub-20ms total overhead
- Proven technologies with active communities
- Cost-effective with zero licensing fees
- Simple deployment with Docker Compose

**Negative:**
- Multiple programming languages (Python, Rust, Go) increase stack complexity
- FastMCP is newer framework with limited production history
- Ollama performance gap vs llama.cpp may impact user experience
- Smaller ecosystems compared to some alternatives

**Neutral:**
- Standard containerization and deployment patterns
- Requires learning multiple technology interfaces
- Community-driven support model

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Docker Compose for simplified deployment and development
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging from start
- Plan for potential migration to llama.cpp in Phase 2
- Engage with FastMCP community for framework evolution
- Pre-package models for air-gapped deployments
