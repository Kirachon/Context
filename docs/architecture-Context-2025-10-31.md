## Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: Microservices Architecture Pattern

**Decision:** Adopt microservices architecture over monolithic design

**Context:** Context requires independent scaling of different components (search, indexing, AI processing), fault isolation, and modular development for team productivity.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Monolithic application
- Service-oriented architecture
- Modular monolith

**Decision:** Microservices architecture with containerized deployment

**Rationale:**
- Enables independent scaling of search vs indexing vs AI processing workloads
- Provides fault isolation preventing single component failures from affecting entire system
- Supports team development with clear component boundaries
- Facilitates gradual deployment and A/B testing of individual components
- Aligns with enterprise deployment patterns and container orchestration

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Scalable, maintainable, team-friendly development
- **Negative:** Increased operational complexity, network overhead
- **Mitigation:** Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes for production, comprehensive monitoring
