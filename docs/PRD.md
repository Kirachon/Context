# Context Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** BMad
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Project Level:** 3
**Target Scale:** Large-scale enterprise software application

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Establish Context as the leading 100% offline AI coding assistant** for privacy-conscious enterprises and open-source developers
- **Achieve enterprise-grade performance** with sub-200ms search latency and support for 1M+ file codebases within 18 months
- **Build a sustainable open-source business model** reaching 1M+ developers and $15M revenue while maintaining core technology freedom
- **Create the reference implementation** for MCP-based AI development tools and establish new standards for privacy-preserving AI
- **Enable developer productivity gains** of 30%+ through contextual AI assistance while maintaining complete data sovereignty

### Background Context

Context addresses a critical gap in the AI development tools market: **the complete absence of truly offline, air-gapped AI coding assistants**. All existing solutions require cloud connectivity for model downloads, updates, or processing, forcing developers to choose between AI capability and data privacy.

The market opportunity is compelling: 73% of enterprises report security concerns as the primary barrier to AI coding assistant adoption, yet developers lose 2-4 hours daily searching for code patterns and understanding codebase context. Current solutions show 60% reduction in relevance when dealing with large, complex codebases (>100K files).

Context's solution combines validated open-source technologies (Qdrant, Ollama, Tree-sitter, FastMCP) achieving a 9.0/10 technical validation score. The architecture delivers sub-20ms total overhead against a <200ms requirement, with 100% local processing that works in air-gapped environments. This positions Context uniquely to serve regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) and open-source projects that cannot compromise data privacy.

The timing is optimal: demand for privacy-preserving AI tools accelerates as data protection regulations tighten, while local AI model performance rapidly improves. With comprehensive technical validation and clear market need, Context is positioned to become the de facto standard for offline AI development tools.

- **Legacy Development Environments** - Modern IDEs and CLI tools prioritized
- **Cloud Development Platforms** - Local and on-premises deployments only
- **Mobile Development Platforms** - Web and desktop development prioritized initially
- **Database Management Systems** - Focus on code repositories, not database administration

**Scope Boundaries for Clarification:**

- **Privacy-first means local-only** - No cloud features in scope for initial releases
- **MCP protocol focus** - Integration with Claude Code CLI is primary; other integrations deferred
- **Enterprise features in phases** - Basic security and compliance in MVP, advanced enterprise features in later phases

**Technical Constraints Acknowledged:**

- **Hardware Requirements** - Minimum specs defined but ultra-low-resource environments not supported
- **Programming Language Support** - Initial focus on mainstream languages; niche languages deferred
- **File Size Limitations** - Optimized for typical codebase sizes; extremely large repositories may require Phase 2 optimizations
- **Network Requirements** - Designed for local processing; network-dependent features are explicitly out of scope
